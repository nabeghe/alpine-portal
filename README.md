Teleports an element to another position based on the defined breakpoint for the screen size.
During real-time screen size changes, the breakpoint is re-evaluated,
and the element may be moved to the second position or returned to the initial position.

## About

This plugin adds a new directive called `x-portal` to Alpine.
`x-portal` is similar to `x-teleport` within Alpine itself, but it has some differences.
`x-portal` is used to teleport an element to another location, with the ability to specify the screen size at which the teleportation should occur.
For example, if the screen size becomes larger or smaller than 1024, the teleportation takes place.
Therefore, it is a screen-size-based teleportation.

Additionally, if the screen size changes continuously, the conditions are re-evaluated.
For example, if the teleportation has already occurred but the conditions are not met after a screen size change (window resize),
the element returns to its initial position.

so `x-portal` can be considered as a two-way portal that creates a pathway from one world (screen size) to another
world (screen size) in order to move elements between them. ðŸ˜…

## Installation

### CDN

Include the following `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of your document, just before Alpine.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nabeghe/alpine-portal@v0.2.x/dist/alpine-portal.min.js" defer></script>
```

### NPM

```bash
npm i alpine-portal
```

Add the `x-portal` directive to your project by importing the package **before** Alpine.js.

```js
import Alpine from 'alpinejs';
import Portal from 'alpine-portal';

Alpine.plugin(Portal);

window.Alpine = Alpine;
window.Alpine.start();
```

## Usage

The `x-portal` directive must be added to the desired element.
The value of the x-portal must be a selector (target) where the element will be teleported to.
Then, you can use the following options to set additional values:

- `x-portal:screen`: Specifies the screen breakpoint based on pixels (a number, e.g. 1024. supports expression).
In positive size, the min-width media query is checked, and in negative size, the max-width media query is examined."
- `x-portal:target`: Instead of specifying the target within the `x-portal` directive, you can write it as 
an expression here.

### Example:

```html
<div x-data id="div1" style="background: #E91E63; padding: 5px;">
    <h2>Div 1</h2>
    <div x-portal="#div2" x-portal:screen="640" x-portal:is="true">
        lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit
    </div>
</div>

<div x-data id="div2"  style="background: #8BC34A; padding: 5px;">
    <h2>Div 2</h2>
</div>
```
Now, if the screen size is greater than or equal to 640, teleportation to the target occurs.
Then, if the screen size goes below 640, the element is returned to its initial position.

If we were to use -640, it would mean that it should be smaller than or equal to that size for the movement to occur.

## Changes

- v0.2.x
    - Instead of using the resize event in the window, matchMedia was used. Thanks to ekvoka [#1](https://github.com/nabeghe/alpine-portal/issues/1). 
    - `x-portal:is` has been removed, and from now on, it can be specified within `x-portal:screen` itself.
- v0.1.x
    - Initial release
